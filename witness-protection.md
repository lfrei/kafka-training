# Witness Protection

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Kafka overview](README.md)

## Scenario in short
* A double agent moves to canton Zurich to collect evidence of a criminal organization. 
* On his journey he is generating **events** which are stored in a traditional database using the Swiss **ech20 standard** defined in XML. An event can be moving-in or moving-out. 
* You work for the canton Zurich as an IT professional and your task is to **ingest and process the events with Kafka**.
* As soon as the double agent is **done**, we need to ensure that **no events** are stored in Kafka anymore. 


## Initial Setup
* 1: **MariaDB** contains all events. It is already prepared with test data of simplified events. JDBC URL: jdbc:mysql://mariadb:3306/events
* 2: **Kafka connect** runs in a Docker container with the name kafka-connect-01. It will be used to ingest the events via JDBC connector. 
* 3: Using **Kafka Streams** to write the data to other topics. 

The folder **uc-witness-protection** contains the material to support the exercises.

## Exercises

### Exercise 0: Connect the database to Kafka

Goals:

* Use Kafka connect to store database rows as events in a Kafka topics
* Learn about setting up the first JDBC connector and become familiar with the RESTful API
* See a connector in action

Exercise:

* Open http://localhost:8085/ to explore the data in the database.To Login please leave the field for the server blank and type for the **username** and **password** "**kafka-training**".
* Examine the template [Exercise0jdbc-connector.json](/uc-witness-protection/connectors/Exercise0jdbc-connector.json) and create a Kafka connector sending a post request with the tool of your choice (curl, Postman,etc.).
* Discover the created events in Kafka via your preferred way.
* Create new test events with pypMyAdmin. It is enough to type random information for the filed "XML_EVENT".
* Why is this configuration not the most suitable for our scenario?
* Bonus: The utilised JDBC connector "JdbcSourceConnector" is not a standard within the container **kafka-connect-01** . Can you figure out from where it is and how we added it?

Hints:

* If you get stuck, check the status of your connector. 
* It might be necessary to restart the Kafka Connect. This can be done by the following command: **docker restart kafka-connect-01**
* How to add content in a table with phpmyadmin can be found here https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/phpmyadmin/create-populate-tables/

üí° If you prefer the console to access the databases use the following command
```
mysql --protocol=TCP -u kafka-training -pkafka-training events
```

### Exercise 1: Alter the connector configuration so that it works appropriate

Goals:

* New events in the database will be only transferred once to Kafka.
* Learning to alter the configuration.

Exercise:

* Update your existing connector with a put request so that new database entries are only synchronised once.
* Clean your existing topic so that there is no previous data inside.
* Create a new database entry based on the event template [Exercise1demo-event.xml](/uc-witness-protection/connectors/Exercise1demo-event.xml) using the filed "XML_EVENT".

Hints:

* The ID column of the table plays an important part for this exercise.

üí° If you prefer the console to access to the databases: mysql --protocol=TCP -u kafka-training -pkafka-training events


### Exercise 2: Consume the events with consumer groups

Goals:

* Share the data of one topic between two consumer.
* Learn how to utilise Kafka mechanism for horizontal scaling with consumer groups.

Exercise:

* Use the topic **mysql-01-events** and make sure the partitions fulfill the requirement of two consumer. 
* Distribute the events for two consumer so that one consumer does not see event of the other consumer.
* Generate test events to simulate the distribution of events.

Hints:
* You can re-create or alter the existing topic.

### Exercise 3: Using a kafka message key
Goals:
* Configuring a Kafka message key for the events.
* The key will later be used to identify the person. 

Exercise:
* Alter the current connector using a key message.
* For message key should the column **PERSON_IDENTIFIER** from the database be used.
* Generate demo data using different values for **PERSON_IDENTIFIER**. Define one identifier for our double agent.

### Exercise 4: Use Kafka streams to forward the events to tax department

Goals:
* Include Kafka streams to the existing environment.
* Create a topic for the tax department and forward every event which contains "<eCH-0020:moveIn>" to the new topic.

Exercise:

* Create a new topic for the tax department with the name **"tax-department"**
* Use the template [Exercise4Stream.java](uc-witness-protection/kafka-stream/src/main/java/com/zuehlke/training/kafka/witnessprotection/stream/Exercise4Stream.java) to implement a stream
* Run the application and check the log output
* Generate events which fulfill the criteria to be in the topics **"tax-department"** and some who doesn't.

Hints:

* Check the course material of the iot use case if you need to refresh your knowledge about streams.

### Exercise 5: Compacting 
The double agent is done with his job. We need to compact all events.

Goals:
* Familiarise yourself with compaction. 
* Updating the topic configuration and executing compaction.

Exercise:
* Recap yourself with the given attributes. cleanup.policy, max.compaction.lag.ms, min.compaction.lag.ms, segment.ms and segment.bytes. 
* Config the topic for compacting using the above-mentioned configuration. The attributes can be changed via akHQ UI. 
* Make sure that there are multiple messages with the same key and execute compaction.

Hint:
* After a new segment is created, we need to send a new message to the same partition to kick-off compaction.
